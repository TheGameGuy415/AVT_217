      <p><span class="italics">"Nitre,"</span> I replied. <span class="italics">"How long have you had that cough?"</span></p>

      <p class="italics">"Ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh!"</span></p>

      <p>My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"It is nothing,"</span> he said, at last.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Come,"</span> I said, with decision, <span class="italics">"we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchresi &mdash;"</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Enough,"</span> he said; <span class="italics">"the cough's a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough."</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"True &mdash;true,"</span> I replied; <span class="italics">"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily &mdash;but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps."</span></p>

      <p>Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the <a href="pg6.html">mould</a>.</p>
