      <p><span class="italics">"Drink,"</span> I said, presenting him the wine.</p>

      <p>He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"I drink,"</span> he said, <span class="italics">"to the buried that repose around us."</span></p>

      <p class="italics">"And I to your long life."</p>

      <p>He again took my arm, and we proceeded.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"These vaults,"</span> he said, <span class="italics">"are <a class= "hidden" href="pg8.html">extensive</a>."</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"The Montresors,"</span> I replied, <span class="italics">"were a great and numerous family."</span></p>

      <p class="italics">"I forget your arms."</p>

      <p class="italics">"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel."</p>

      <p class="italics">"And the motto?"</p>

      <p class="italics">"Nemo me impune lacessit."</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Good!"</span> he said.</p>

      <p>The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the <a href="pg7.html">elbow</a>.</p>
