      <p>There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.</p>

      <p>I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the <a href="pg8.html" class="hidden">catacombs</a> of the Montresors.</p>

      <p>The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"The pipe,"</span> he said. <span class="italics">"It is farther on,"</span> said I; <span class="italics">"but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls."</span> He turned towards me, and looked into my eves with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of <a href="pg5.html">intoxication</a>.</p>
