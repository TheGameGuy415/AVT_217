      <p>It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Proceed,"</span> I said; <span class="italics">"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchresi &mdash;"</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"He is an ignoramus,"</span> interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Pass your hand,"</span> I said, <span class="italics">"<a class= "hidden" href="pg11.html">over the wall</a>; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed, it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power."</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"The Amontillado!"</span> ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"True,"</span> I replied; <a href="pg10.html"><span class="italics">"the Amontillado."</a></span></p>
