      <p>The voice said-- <span class="italics">"Ha! ha! ha! --he! he! he! --a very good joke, indeed --an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo --he! he! he! --over our wine --he! he! he!"</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"The Amontillado!" I said.</p>

      <p class="italics">"He! he! he! --he! he! he! --yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone."</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Yes," I said, <span class="italics">"let us be gone."</p>

      <p class="italics">"For the love of God, Montresor!"</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Yes," I said, <span class="italics">"for the love of God!"</p>

      <p>But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud --</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Fortunato!"</p>

      <p>No answer. I called again --</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Fortunato!"</p>

      <p>No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. <a href="pg1.html">In pace requiescat!</a></p>
