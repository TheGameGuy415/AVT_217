      <p><span class="italics">"The nitre!"</span> I said; <span class="italics">"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough --"</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"It is nothing,"</span> he said; <span class="italics">"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc."</span></p>

      <p>I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.</p>

      <p>I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement --a grotesque one.</p>

      <p>"You do not comprehend?"</span> he said.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Not I,"</span> I replied.</p>

      <p class="italics">"Then you are not of the brotherhood."</p>

      <p class="italics">"How?"</p>

      <p class="italics">"You are not of the masons."</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Yes, yes,"</span> I said; <span class="italics">"yes, yes."</span></p>

      <p class="italics">"You? Impossible! A mason?"</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"A mason,"</span> I replied.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"A sign,"</span> he said, <span class="italics">"a sign."</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"It is this,"</span> I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">"You jest,"</span> he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. <span class="italics">"But let us proceed to the Amontillado."</span></p>

      <p><span class="italics">"Be it so,"</span> I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than <a href="pg8.html">flame.</a></p>
